power-on/reset.

AFC may also be disabled on a per-personality basis via Clone Write. The radio

Clone Write

This message is used by the master radio to insert cloning specific 
information into the slave radio during the cloning operation. It is also used 
by attached devices to write codeplug data into the radio. This message allows 
one or more fields to be transferred simultaneously (up to the maximum packet 
size allowed by the transport layer).

The CLONEWR command is subject to the following restrictions:
	Radio must be in Device Control Mode for all XCMP Versions except V2.0.0.4; 
	The device sending the CLONEWR command must have its authentication level 
	set to 2 for all XCMP Versions except V2.0.0.4. XCMP V2.0.0.4 must have 
	authentication level set to 1; 
	CLONEWR can only be used the two virtual personalities (i.e. Zone Number: 
	0xFFFF, Channel Number: 0x01 / 0x02);
	
All Field IDs in the Clone Write message which are recognized by the radio and 
have valid values will be committed to the Virtual Personality of the radio by 
the time that the Clone Write Reply message is sent. Out of range values or 
unrecognized fields will not be committed to the Virtual Personality of the 
radio.

NOTE: Capacity Plus System Channel does not support CLONEWR. Sending a clone 
write request in this channel will cause unexpected behavior.

/*
Device Initialization Status

This message is used to announce that a device is present, as well as to 
provide information about the basic capabilities of that device. This message 
is also sent by the  master to indicate that device initialization is 
complete. This is an indication that all devices may begin their normal XCMP 
messaging. 

When a non-master device powers up, it must first wait for the master to send 
its Device Initialization Status broadcast before sending its own 
initialization message. However, the non-master device must send this message 
within 1 second of the masterˉs device initialization broadcast. Once power up 
is completed, the master will send out a Device Initialization Complete 
message. 

If a single physical device supports more than one device type, the device 
must send a separate power-up status message for each supported type.

XCMP does not limit the implementation of how to handle the message sequence, 
which is specific to the product and shall be defined by products. Here is a 
recommended solution:

After the master powers up, it broadcasts its Device Initialization Status 
message. Upon receiving the Device Initialization Status from the master, all 
devices broadcast their Device Initialization Status messages. There may be 
situations where a device powers up late or the master receives a device 
initialization after master sends out the Device Initialization Complete 
message. If the master detects that a new device powered on or it receives a 
Device Initialization Status message from a device after sending out Device 
Initialization Complete message then the Master sends out a Device 
Initialization Status message again to trigger all devices including the new 
device to resynchronize their status. Resending this message does not imply 
that devices should disconnect and reconnect.

Sending this message can cause the system configuration to change. The 463 
implementation of how to handle the device init message sequence is specific 
to the 464 product and shall be defined by products.

/*
Tone Control

This message is used to control logical tones. A logical tone is a predefined 
tone, defined by the handler of the request. A unique tone identifier will be 
associated with each tone. For logical tones, the same logical tone identifier 
is returned.

Momentary tones have higher priority than both continuous tones and received 
audio. Received audio has higher priority than continuous tones. It is 
possible that a logical continuous tone may get converted into a momentary 
tone if it is requested during received audio.

Momentary tones may be played while the radio is transmitting if the 
microphone is muted during the playing of the tone so that it is not 
transmitted with the transmitted audio. It is up to the tone-handling device 
to make this determination. Continuous tones will be suspended or queued 
during voice transmit mode.

Voice tones and signaling tones are not supported by this opcode.

Due to the finite and short duration, of a momentary tone, a Stopped state 
change may not be broadcast. This means that the device may only broadcast out 
the starting of a  momentary tone. 

The broadcast message type is disabled by default. A device requiring this 
message must send a Device Initialization Status with a Device Speaker Type 
attribute of XCMP_DEVICE_SPKR_PWR. Otherwise, the radio will not send out any 
broadcast message. See section 4.3 for more information. The broadcast message 
is delivered to all XCMP devices when it is enabled by any one of the XCMP 
devices.

Volume Control
This message is used to request information about a device's volume control state, or to
request a change in volume control state. Because the actual device used as a volume
attenuator can be different in various devices, XCMP assumes an idealized volume
attenuator which provides 256 steps, with each step being an equal increment on an audio or logarithmic response.
In all cases, this request will result in a Volume Control Reply giving the status of the volume control.
In addition, if the volume attenuator setting is changed, a Volume Control State broadcast will also be sent.
The Volume Data for all functions is specified in terms of the 0-255 range of the 256
step attenuator. The value of 255 is interpreted as maximum volume (minimum attenuation), and 0 is interpreted as minimum volume (maximum attenuation). 
Note that a value of 0 may still result in some audio, the Speaker Control message should be used if it is desired to mute the speaker.
