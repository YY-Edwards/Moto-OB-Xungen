This message is sent by a non-master device in order to query the system to

MASTER_STATUS_BRDCST message no matter the XNL connection is established or 
not with this non-master device. This message allows for timing differences in 
devices. If the master takes longer than the device to power up, the device 
can continue to send out this query until the master is determined. In the 
same way, if a device is attached after the master has already been 
determined, it provides a way for the device to find out which device is 
master. This message does not contain any payload data. 

The non-slave device can use either the XNL address of the master device or 
0x0000 to send the DEVICE_MASTER_QUERY to the master device. However, for all 
other XNL control messages: DEVICE_AUTH_KEY_REQUEST, DEVICE_CONN_REQUEST, and 
DEVICE_SYSMAP_REQUEST, the non-slave device should use the master XNL address 
as the destination address. The master XNL address can be gotten from the 
source field of the MASTER_STATUS_BRDCST message.
